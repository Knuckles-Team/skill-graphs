# the handle's result to wait for cancellation to be applied.
handle.cancel
```

By default, Activities are automatically cancelled when the Workflow is cancelled since the workflow cancellation is
used by activities by default. To issue a cancellation explicitly, a new cancellation token can be created.

```ruby
class MyWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute
    # Create a new cancellation linked to the workflow one, so that it inherits
    # cancellation that comes from the workflow. Users can choose to make it
    # completely detached by not providing a parent.
    cancellation, cancel_proc = Temporalio::Cancellation.new(
      Temporalio::Workflow.cancellation
    )

    # Start the activity in the background. Whether this workflow waits on the activity
    # to handle the cancellation or not is dependent upon the cancellation_type
    # parameter. We leave the default here which sends the cancellation but does not wait
    # on it to be handled.
    future = Temporalio::Future.new do
      Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
        MyActivity,
        start_to_close_timeout: 100,
        cancellation:
      )
    end

    # Wait 5 minutes, then cancel it
    Temporalio::Workflow.sleep(5 * 60)
    cancel_proc.call

    # Wait on the activity which will raise an activity error with a cause of
    # cancellation which will fail the workflow
    future.wait
  end
end
```

## Termination {/* #termination */}

To Terminate a Workflow Execution in Ruby, use the `terminate` method on the Workflow handle.

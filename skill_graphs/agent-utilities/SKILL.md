# agent-utilities — Master Skill Reference

**CONCEPT:ECO-4.12 — Self-Documenting Skill-Graph**

agent-utilities is a self-evolving AI framework built on 5 pillars. This skill-graph
provides agents (Antigravity, Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode) with complete context
for using, developing, and extending the framework.

## 🏗️ Architecture — The 5 Pillars

| Pillar | ID Prefix | Purpose | Key Modules |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Graph Orchestration** | `ORCH-1.x` | Multi-agent coordination, HTN planning, routing | `graph/`, `orchestration/` |
| **Epistemic Knowledge Graph** | `KG-2.x` | Semantic storage, OWL ontologies, retrieval, memory | `knowledge_graph/` |
| **Agentic Harness Engineering** | `AHE-3.x` | Self-improvement, testing, evolution | `harness/`, `agentic_evolution/` |
| **Ecosystem & Peripherals** | `ECO-4.x` | MCP servers, API clients, messaging, tools | `mcp/`, `tools/`, `ecosystem/` |
| **Agent OS Infrastructure** | `OS-5.x` | Security, scheduling, identity, guardrails | `core/`, `security/`, `observability/` |

## 📍 Quick Navigation

| Need | Skill |
|------|-------|
| **Deploy** agent-utilities (zero-infra default, MCP servers, gateway, prod) | → [deployment/SKILL.md](deployment/SKILL.md) |
| Understand how to **develop** for agent-utilities | → [development/SKILL.md](development/SKILL.md) |
| Use agent-utilities **tools** (X search, KG, workflows) | → [tools/SKILL.md](tools/SKILL.md) |
| Work with **OWL ontologies** | → [ontology/SKILL.md](ontology/SKILL.md) |
| Understand the **5-pillar architecture** | → [pillars/SKILL.md](pillars/SKILL.md) |

## 🧬 Concept ID System

Every feature in agent-utilities has a `CONCEPT:X.Y` tag providing 1:1:1 traceability:

```
CONCEPT:ORCH-1.2  →  code: graph/routing.py
                  →  test: tests/unit/graph/test_routing.py
                  →  docs: docs/pillars/1_graph_orchestration/ORCH-1.2.md
```

**40 canonical concepts** across 5 pillars. All new features require DSTDD design phase.
See `docs/concept_map.md` for the complete registry.

## 🔧 Core Dependencies

- **Pydantic AI**: Agent framework with structured output
- **NetworkX**: Graph engine for KG operations
- **RDFLib/OWLReady2**: OWL ontology reasoning
- **LM Studio**: Default local LLM backend (vllm.arpa)

## 🤖 Agent Usage Guide

- When developing FOR agent-utilities, consult [development/SKILL.md](development/SKILL.md)
- When USING agent-utilities tools, consult [tools/SKILL.md](tools/SKILL.md)
- Every code module has a `CONCEPT:X.Y` tag in its docstring — use this for traceability
- All prompts live in `agent_utilities/prompts/*.json` — reference by agent name
- OWL ontologies are in `knowledge_graph/ontology_*.ttl`
- The KG MCP server (`graph-os`) exposes `graph_query`, `graph_search`, `graph_write`,
  `graph_analyze`, `graph_ingest`, and `graph_orchestrate`

# use client
Last updated February 27, 2026
The `'use client'` directive declares an entry point for the components to be rendered on the **client side** and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature.
> **Good to know:**
> You do not need to add the `'use client'` directive to every file that contains Client Components. You only need to add it to the files whose components you want to render directly within Server Components. The `'use client'` directive defines the client-server [boundary](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#network-boundary), and the components exported from such a file serve as entry points to the client.

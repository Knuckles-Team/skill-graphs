## Create with the CLI[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation#create-with-the-cli)
The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:
pnpmnpmyarnbun
Terminal
```
pnpm create next-app
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:
Terminal
```
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults?
    Yes, use recommended defaults - TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, Turbopack
    No, reuse previous settings
    No, customize settings - Choose your own preferences
```

If you choose to `customize settings`, you'll see the following prompts:
Terminal
```
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Which linter would you like to use? ESLint / Biome / None
Would you like to use React Compiler? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

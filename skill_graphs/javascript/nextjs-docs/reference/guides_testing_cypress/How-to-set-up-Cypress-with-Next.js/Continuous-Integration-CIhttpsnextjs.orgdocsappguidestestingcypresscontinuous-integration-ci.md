## Continuous Integration (CI)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/cypress#continuous-integration-ci)
In addition to interactive testing, you can also run Cypress headlessly using the `cypress run` command, which is better suited for CI environments:
package.json
```
{
  "scripts": {
    //...
    "e2e": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \"cypress open --e2e\"",
    "e2e:headless": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \"cypress run --e2e\"",
    "component": "cypress open --component",
    "component:headless": "cypress run --component"
  }
}
```

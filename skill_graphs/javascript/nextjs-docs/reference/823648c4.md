##  `next()`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response#next)
The `next()` method is useful for Proxy, as it allows you to return early and continue routing.
```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

return NextResponse.next()
```

You can also forward `headers` upstream when producing the response, using `NextResponse.next({ request: { headers } })`:
```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// Given an incoming request...
const newHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
// Add a new header
newHeaders.set('x-version', '123')
// Forward the modified request headers upstream
return NextResponse.next({
  request: {
    // New request headers
    headers: newHeaders,
  },
})
```

This forwards `newHeaders` upstream to the target page, route, or server action, and does not expose them to the client. While this pattern is useful for passing data upstream, it should be used with caution because the headers containing this data may be forwarded to external services.
In contrast, `NextResponse.next({ headers })` is a shorthand for sending headers from proxy to the client. This is **NOT** good practice and should be avoided. Among other reasons because setting response headers like `Content-Type`, can override framework expectations (for example, the `Content-Type` used by Server Actions), leading to failed submissions or broken streaming responses.
```
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

async function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  const headers = await injectAuth(request.headers)
  // DO NOT forward headers like this
  return NextResponse.next({ headers })
}
```

In general, avoid copying all incoming request headers because doing so can leak sensitive data to clients or upstream services.
Prefer a defensive approach by creating a subset of incoming request headers using an allow-list. For example, you might discard custom `x-*` headers and only forward known-safe headers:
```
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  const incoming = new Headers(request.headers)
  const forwarded = new Headers()

  for (const [name, value] of incoming) {
    const headerName = name.toLowerCase()
    // Keep only known-safe headers, discard custom x-* and other sensitive ones
    if (
      !headerName.startsWith('x-') &&
      headerName !== 'authorization' &&
      headerName !== 'cookie'
    ) {
      // Preserve original header name casing
      forwarded.set(name, value)
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: forwarded,
    },
  })
}
```

##  `next/dynamic`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/lazy-loading#nextdynamic-1)
`next/dynamic` is a composite of `app` and `pages` directories to allow for incremental migration.
In the example below, by using `next/dynamic`, the header component will not be included in the page's initial JavaScript bundle. The page will render the Suspense `fallback` first, followed by the `Header` component when the `Suspense` boundary is resolved.
```
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
})

export default function Home() {
  return <DynamicHeader />
}
```

> **Good to know** : In `import('path/to/component')`, the path must be explicitly written. It can't be a template string nor a variable. Furthermore the `import()` has to be inside the `dynamic()` call for Next.js to be able to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific `dynamic()` call and preload them before rendering. `dynamic()` can't be used inside of React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module for preloading to work, similar to `React.lazy`.

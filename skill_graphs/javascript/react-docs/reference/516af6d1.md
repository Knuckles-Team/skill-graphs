The problem with this code is in suppressing the dependency linter. If you remove the suppression, you'll see that this Effect should depend on the `handleMove` function. This makes sense: `handleMove` is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!

The author of the original code has "lied" to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (`[]`) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after `canMove` has changed (and `handleMove` with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the `handleMove` attached as a listener is the `handleMove` function created during the initial render. During the initial render, `canMove` was `true`, which is why `handleMove` from the initial render will forever see that value.

**If you never suppress the linter, you will never see problems with stale values.**

With `useEffectEvent`, there is no need to "lie" to the linter, and the code works as you would expect:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  const onMove = useEffectEvent(e => {
    if (canMove) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', onMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', onMove);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)}
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

This doesn't mean that `useEffectEvent` is *always* the correct solution. You should only apply it to the lines of code that you don't want to be reactive. In the above sandbox, you didn't want the Effect's code to be reactive with regards to `canMove`. That's why it made sense to extract an Effect Event.

Read [Removing Effect Dependencies](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) for other correct alternatives to suppressing the linter.

</DeepDive>

### Limitations of Effect Events {/*limitations-of-effect-events*/}

Effect Events are very limited in how you can use them:

* **Only call them from inside Effects.**
* **Never pass them to other components or Hooks.**

For example, don't declare and pass an Effect Event like this:

```js {4-6,8}
function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  });

  useTimer(onTick, 1000); // 🔴 Avoid: Passing Effect Events

  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}

function useTimer(callback, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      callback();
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay, callback]); // Need to specify "callback" in dependencies
}
```

Instead, always declare Effect Events directly next to the Effects that use them:

```js {10-12,16,21}
function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useTimer(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, 1000);
  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}

function useTimer(callback, delay) {
  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    callback();
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick(); // ✅ Good: Only called locally inside an Effect
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay]); // No need to specify "onTick" (an Effect Event) as a dependency
}
```

Effect Events are non-reactive "pieces" of your Effect code. They should be next to the Effect using them.

<Recap>

- Event handlers run in response to specific interactions.
- Effects run whenever synchronization is needed.
- Logic inside event handlers is not reactive.
- Logic inside Effects is reactive.
- You can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effect Events.
- Only call Effect Events from inside Effects.
- Don't pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.

#### Fix a variable that doesn't update {/*fix-a-variable-that-doesnt-update*/}

This `Timer` component keeps a `count` state variable which increases every second. The value by which it's increasing is stored in the `increment` state variable. You can control the `increment` variable with the plus and minus buttons.

However, no matter how many times you click the plus button, the counter is still incremented by one every second. What's wrong with this code? Why is `increment` always equal to `1` inside the Effect's code? Find the mistake and fix it.

<Hint>

To fix this code, it's enough to follow the rules.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [14]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + increment);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

As usual, when you're looking for bugs in Effects, start by searching for linter suppressions.

If you remove the suppression comment, React will tell you that this Effect's code depends on `increment`, but you "lied" to React by claiming that this Effect does not depend on any reactive values (`[]`). Add `increment` to the dependency array:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + increment);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [increment]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Now, when `increment` changes, React will re-synchronize your Effect, which will restart the interval.

</Solution>

#### Fix a freezing counter {/*fix-a-freezing-counter*/}

This `Timer` component keeps a `count` state variable which increases every second. The value by which it's increasing is stored in the `increment` state variable, which you can control it with the plus and minus buttons. For example, try pressing the plus button nine times, and notice that the `count` now increases each second by ten rather than by one.

There is a small issue with this user interface. You might notice that if you keep pressing the plus or minus buttons faster than once per second, the timer itself seems to pause. It only resumes after a second passes since the last time you've pressed either button. Find why this is happening, and fix the issue so that the timer ticks on *every* second without interruptions.

<Hint>

It seems like the Effect which sets up the timer "reacts" to the `increment` value. Does the line that uses the current `increment` value in order to call `setCount` really need to be reactive?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + increment);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [increment]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The issue is that the code inside the Effect uses the `increment` state variable. Since it's a dependency of your Effect, every change to `increment` causes the Effect to re-synchronize, which causes the interval to clear. If you keep clearing the interval every time before it has a chance to fire, it will appear as if the timer has stalled.

To solve the issue, extract an `onTick` Effect Event from the Effect:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(c => c + increment);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick();
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Since `onTick` is an Effect Event, the code inside it isn't reactive. The change to `increment` does not trigger any Effects.

</Solution>

#### Fix a non-adjustable delay {/*fix-a-non-adjustable-delay*/}

In this example, you can customize the interval delay. It's stored in a `delay` state variable which is updated by two buttons. However, even if you press the "plus 100 ms" button until the `delay` is 1000 milliseconds (that is, a second), you'll notice that the timer still increments very fast (every 100 ms). It's as if your changes to the `delay` are ignored. Find and fix the bug.

<Hint>

Code inside Effect Events is not reactive. Are there cases in which you would _want_ the `setInterval` call to re-run?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(100);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(c => c + increment);
  });

  const onMount = useEffectEvent(() => {
    return setInterval(() => {
      onTick();
    }, delay);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = onMount();
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        Increment delay:
        <button disabled={delay === 100} onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d - 100);
        }}>–100 ms</button>
        <b>{delay} ms</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d + 100);
        }}>+100 ms</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The problem with the above example is that it extracted an Effect Event called `onMount` without considering what the code should actually be doing. You should only extract Effect Events for a specific reason: when you want to make a part of your code non-reactive. However, the `setInterval` call *should* be reactive with respect to the `delay` state variable. If the `delay` changes, you want to set up the interval from scratch! To fix this code, pull all the reactive code back inside the Effect:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(100);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(c => c + increment);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick();
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    }
  }, [delay]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        Increment delay:
        <button disabled={delay === 100} onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d - 100);
        }}>–100 ms</button>
        <b>{delay} ms</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d + 100);
        }}>+100 ms</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In general, you should be suspicious of functions like `onMount` that focus on the *timing* rather than the *purpose* of a piece of code. It may feel "more descriptive" at first but it obscures your intent. As a rule of thumb, Effect Events should correspond to something that happens from the *user's* perspective. For example, `onMessage`, `onTick`, `onVisit`, or `onConnected` are good Effect Event names. Code inside them would likely not need to be reactive. On the other hand, `onMount`, `onUpdate`, `onUnmount`, or `onAfterRender` are so generic that it's easy to accidentally put code that *should* be reactive into them. This is why you should name your Effect Events after *what the user thinks has happened,* not when some code happened to run.

#### Fix a delayed notification {/*fix-a-delayed-notification*/}

When you join a chat room, this component shows a notification. However, it doesn't show the notification immediately. Instead, the notification is artificially delayed by two seconds so that the user has a chance to look around the UI.

This almost works, but there is a bug. Try changing the dropdown from "general" to "travel" and then to "music" very quickly. If you do it fast enough, you will see two notifications (as expected!) but they will *both* say "Welcome to music".

Fix it so that when you switch from "general" to "travel" and then to "music" very quickly, you see two notifications, the first one being "Welcome to travel" and the second one being "Welcome to music". (For an additional challenge, assuming you've *already* made the notifications show the correct rooms, change the code so that only the latter notification is displayed.)

<Hint>

Your Effect knows which room it connected to. Is there any information that you might want to pass to your Effect Event?

<Solution>

Inside your Effect Event, `roomId` is the value *at the time Effect Event was called.*

Your Effect Event is called with a two second delay. If you're quickly switching from the travel to the music room, by the time the travel room's notification shows, `roomId` is already `"music"`. This is why both notifications say "Welcome to music".

To fix the issue, instead of reading the *latest* `roomId` inside the Effect Event, make it a parameter of your Effect Event, like `connectedRoomId` below. Then pass `roomId` from your Effect by calling `onConnected(roomId)`:

The Effect that had `roomId` set to `"travel"` (so it connected to the `"travel"` room) will show the notification for `"travel"`. The Effect that had `roomId` set to `"music"` (so it connected to the `"music"` room) will show the notification for `"music"`. In other words, `connectedRoomId` comes from your Effect (which is reactive), while `theme` always uses the latest value.

To solve the additional challenge, save the notification timeout ID and clear it in the cleanup function of your Effect:

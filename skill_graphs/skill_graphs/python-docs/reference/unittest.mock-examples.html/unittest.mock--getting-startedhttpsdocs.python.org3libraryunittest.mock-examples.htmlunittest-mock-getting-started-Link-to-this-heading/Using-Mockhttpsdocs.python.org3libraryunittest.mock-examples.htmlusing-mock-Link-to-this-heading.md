## Using Mock[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#using-mock "Link to this heading")
### Mock Patching Methods[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#mock-patching-methods "Link to this heading")
Common uses for [`Mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock "unittest.mock.Mock") objects include:
  * Patching methods
  * Recording method calls on objects


You might want to replace a method on an object to check that it is called with the correct arguments by another part of the system:
Copy```
>>> real = SomeClass()
>>> real.method = MagicMock(name='method')
>>> real.method(3, 4, 5, key='value')
<MagicMock name='method()' id='...'>

```

Once our mock has been used (`real.method` in this example) it has methods and attributes that allow you to make assertions about how it has been used.
Note
In most of these examples the [`Mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock "unittest.mock.Mock") and [`MagicMock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock "unittest.mock.MagicMock") classes are interchangeable. As the `MagicMock` is the more capable class it makes a sensible one to use by default.
Once the mock has been called its [`called`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.called "unittest.mock.Mock.called") attribute is set to `True`. More importantly we can use the [`assert_called_with()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_with "unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_with") or [`assert_called_once_with()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_once_with "unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_once_with") method to check that it was called with the correct arguments.
This example tests that calling `ProductionClass().method` results in a call to the `something` method:
Copy```
>>> class ProductionClass:
...     def method(self):
...         self.something(1, 2, 3)
...     def something(self, a, b, c):
...         pass
...
>>> real = ProductionClass()
>>> real.something = MagicMock()
>>> real.method()
>>> real.something.assert_called_once_with(1, 2, 3)

```

### Mock for Method Calls on an Object[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#mock-for-method-calls-on-an-object "Link to this heading")
In the last example we patched a method directly on an object to check that it was called correctly. Another common use case is to pass an object into a method (or some part of the system under test) and then check that it is used in the correct way.
The simple `ProductionClass` below has a `closer` method. If it is called with an object then it calls `close` on it.
Copy```
>>> class ProductionClass:
...     def closer(self, something):
...         something.close()
...

```

So to test it we need to pass in an object with a `close` method and check that it was called correctly.
Copy```
>>> real = ProductionClass()
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> real.closer(mock)
>>> mock.close.assert_called_with()

```

We don’t have to do any work to provide the ‘close’ method on our mock. Accessing close creates it. So, if ‘close’ hasn’t already been called then accessing it in the test will create it, but [`assert_called_with()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_with "unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_with") will raise a failure exception.
### Mocking Classes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#mocking-classes "Link to this heading")
A common use case is to mock out classes instantiated by your code under test. When you patch a class, then that class is replaced with a mock. Instances are created by _calling the class_. This means you access the “mock instance” by looking at the return value of the mocked class.
In the example below we have a function `some_function` that instantiates `Foo` and calls a method on it. The call to [`patch()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch "unittest.mock.patch") replaces the class `Foo` with a mock. The `Foo` instance is the result of calling the mock, so it is configured by modifying the mock [`return_value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.return_value "unittest.mock.Mock.return_value").
Copy```
>>> def some_function():
...     instance = module.Foo()
...     return instance.method()
...
>>> with patch('module.Foo') as mock:
...     instance = mock.return_value
...     instance.method.return_value = 'the result'
...     result = some_function()
...     assert result == 'the result'

```

### Naming your mocks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#naming-your-mocks "Link to this heading")
It can be useful to give your mocks a name. The name is shown in the repr of the mock and can be helpful when the mock appears in test failure messages. The name is also propagated to attributes or methods of the mock:
Copy```
>>> mock = MagicMock(name='foo')
>>> mock
<MagicMock name='foo' id='...'>
>>> mock.method
<MagicMock name='foo.method' id='...'>

```

### Tracking all Calls[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#tracking-all-calls "Link to this heading")
Often you want to track more than a single call to a method. The [`mock_calls`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.mock_calls "unittest.mock.Mock.mock_calls") attribute records all calls to child attributes of the mock - and also to their children.
Copy```
>>> mock = MagicMock()
>>> mock.method()
<MagicMock name='mock.method()' id='...'>
>>> mock.attribute.method(10, x=53)
<MagicMock name='mock.attribute.method()' id='...'>
>>> mock.mock_calls
[call.method(), call.attribute.method(10, x=53)]

```

If you make an assertion about `mock_calls` and any unexpected methods have been called, then the assertion will fail. This is useful because as well as asserting that the calls you expected have been made, you are also checking that they were made in the right order and with no additional calls:
You use the [`call`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.call "unittest.mock.call") object to construct lists for comparing with `mock_calls`:
Copy```
>>> expected = [call.method(), call.attribute.method(10, x=53)]
>>> mock.mock_calls == expected
True

```

However, parameters to calls that return mocks are not recorded, which means it is not possible to track nested calls where the parameters used to create ancestors are important:
Copy```
>>> m = Mock()
>>> m.factory(important=True).deliver()
<Mock name='mock.factory().deliver()' id='...'>
>>> m.mock_calls[-1] == call.factory(important=False).deliver()
True

```

### Setting Return Values and Attributes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#setting-return-values-and-attributes "Link to this heading")
Setting the return values on a mock object is trivially easy:
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> mock.return_value = 3
>>> mock()
3

```

Of course you can do the same for methods on the mock:
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> mock.method.return_value = 3
>>> mock.method()
3

```

The return value can also be set in the constructor:
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock(return_value=3)
>>> mock()
3

```

If you need an attribute setting on your mock, just do it:
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> mock.x = 3
>>> mock.x
3

```

Sometimes you want to mock up a more complex situation, like for example `mock.connection.cursor().execute("SELECT 1")`. If we wanted this call to return a list, then we have to configure the result of the nested call.
We can use [`call`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.call "unittest.mock.call") to construct the set of calls in a “chained call” like this for easy assertion afterwards:
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock()
>>> cursor = mock.connection.cursor.return_value
>>> cursor.execute.return_value = ['foo']
>>> mock.connection.cursor().execute("SELECT 1")
['foo']
>>> expected = call.connection.cursor().execute("SELECT 1").call_list()
>>> mock.mock_calls
[call.connection.cursor(), call.connection.cursor().execute('SELECT 1')]
>>> mock.mock_calls == expected
True

```

It is the call to `.call_list()` that turns our call object into a list of calls representing the chained calls.
### Raising exceptions with mocks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#raising-exceptions-with-mocks "Link to this heading")
A useful attribute is [`side_effect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect "unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect"). If you set this to an exception class or instance then the exception will be raised when the mock is called.
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock(side_effect=Exception('Boom!'))
>>> mock()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
Exception: Boom!

```

### Side effect functions and iterables[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#side-effect-functions-and-iterables "Link to this heading")
`side_effect` can also be set to a function or an iterable. The use case for `side_effect` as an iterable is where your mock is going to be called several times, and you want each call to return a different value. When you set `side_effect` to an iterable every call to the mock returns the next value from the iterable:
Copy```
>>> mock = MagicMock(side_effect=[4, 5, 6])
>>> mock()
4
>>> mock()
5
>>> mock()
6

```

For more advanced use cases, like dynamically varying the return values depending on what the mock is called with, `side_effect` can be a function. The function will be called with the same arguments as the mock. Whatever the function returns is what the call returns:
Copy```
>>> vals = {(1, 2): 1, (2, 3): 2}
>>> def side_effect(*args):
...     return vals[args]
...
>>> mock = MagicMock(side_effect=side_effect)
>>> mock(1, 2)
1
>>> mock(2, 3)
2

```

### Mocking asynchronous iterators[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#mocking-asynchronous-iterators "Link to this heading")
Since Python 3.8, `AsyncMock` and `MagicMock` have support to mock [Asynchronous Iterators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#async-iterators) through `__aiter__`. The [`return_value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.return_value "unittest.mock.Mock.return_value") attribute of `__aiter__` can be used to set the return values to be used for iteration.
Copy```
>>> mock = MagicMock()  # AsyncMock also works here
>>> mock.__aiter__.return_value = [1, 2, 3]
>>> async def main():
...     return [i async for i in mock]
...
>>> asyncio.run(main())
[1, 2, 3]

```

### Mocking asynchronous context manager[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#mocking-asynchronous-context-manager "Link to this heading")
Since Python 3.8, `AsyncMock` and `MagicMock` have support to mock [Asynchronous Context Managers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers) through `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`. By default, `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` are `AsyncMock` instances that return an async function.
Copy```
>>> class AsyncContextManager:
...     async def __aenter__(self):
...         return self
...     async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
...         pass
...
>>> mock_instance = MagicMock(AsyncContextManager())  # AsyncMock also works here
>>> async def main():
...     async with mock_instance as result:
...         pass
...
>>> asyncio.run(main())
>>> mock_instance.__aenter__.assert_awaited_once()
>>> mock_instance.__aexit__.assert_awaited_once()

```

### Creating a Mock from an Existing Object[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#creating-a-mock-from-an-existing-object "Link to this heading")
One problem with over use of mocking is that it couples your tests to the implementation of your mocks rather than your real code. Suppose you have a class that implements `some_method`. In a test for another class, you provide a mock of this object that _also_ provides `some_method`. If later you refactor the first class, so that it no longer has `some_method` - then your tests will continue to pass even though your code is now broken!
[`Mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock "unittest.mock.Mock") allows you to provide an object as a specification for the mock, using the _spec_ keyword argument. Accessing methods / attributes on the mock that don’t exist on your specification object will immediately raise an attribute error. If you change the implementation of your specification, then tests that use that class will start failing immediately without you having to instantiate the class in those tests.
Copy```
>>> mock = Mock(spec=SomeClass)
>>> mock.old_method()
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
AttributeError: Mock object has no attribute 'old_method'. Did you mean: 'class_method'?

```

Using a specification also enables a smarter matching of calls made to the mock, regardless of whether some parameters were passed as positional or named arguments:
Copy```
>>> def f(a, b, c): pass
...
>>> mock = Mock(spec=f)
>>> mock(1, 2, 3)
<Mock name='mock()' id='140161580456576'>
>>> mock.assert_called_with(a=1, b=2, c=3)

```

If you want this smarter matching to also work with method calls on the mock, you can use [auto-speccing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#auto-speccing).
If you want a stronger form of specification that prevents the setting of arbitrary attributes as well as the getting of them then you can use _spec_set_ instead of _spec_.
### Using side_effect to return per file content[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#using-side-effect-to-return-per-file-content "Link to this heading")
[`mock_open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.mock_open "unittest.mock.mock_open") is used to patch [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") method. [`side_effect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect "unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect") can be used to return a new Mock object per call. This can be used to return different contents per file stored in a dictionary:
Copy```
DEFAULT = "default"
data_dict = {"file1": "data1",
             "file2": "data2"}

def open_side_effect(name):
    return mock_open(read_data=data_dict.get(name, DEFAULT))()

with patch("builtins.open", side_effect=open_side_effect):
    with open("file1") as file1:
        assert file1.read() == "data1"

    with open("file2") as file2:
        assert file2.read() == "data2"

    with open("file3") as file2:
        assert file2.read() == "default"

```

## [Introduction](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#introduction)
Before digging into Laravel Horizon, you should familiarize yourself with Laravel's base [queue services](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queues). Horizon augments Laravel's queue with additional features that may be confusing if you are not already familiar with the basic queue features offered by Laravel.
[Redis queues](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queues). Horizon allows you to easily monitor key metrics of your queue system such as job throughput, runtime, and job failures.
When using Horizon, all of your queue worker configuration is stored in a single, simple configuration file. By defining your application's worker configuration in a version controlled file, you may easily scale or modify your application's queue workers when deploying your application.
![](https://laravel.com/img/docs/horizon-example.png)
## [Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#installation)
Laravel Horizon requires that you use `redis` in your application's `config/queue.php` configuration file. Horizon is not compatible with Redis Cluster at this time.
You may install Horizon into your project using the Composer package manager:
```


1composer require laravel/horizon




composer require laravel/horizon

```

After installing Horizon, publish its assets using the `horizon:install` Artisan command:
```


1php artisan horizon:install




php artisan horizon:install

```

### [Configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#configuration)
After publishing Horizon's assets, its primary configuration file will be located at `config/horizon.php`. This configuration file allows you to configure the queue worker options for your application. Each configuration option includes a description of its purpose, so be sure to thoroughly explore this file.
Horizon uses a Redis connection named `horizon` internally. This Redis connection name is reserved and should not be assigned to another Redis connection in the `database.php` configuration file or as the value of the `use` option in the `horizon.php` configuration file.
#### [Environments](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#environments)
After installation, the primary Horizon configuration option that you should familiarize yourself with is the `environments` configuration option. This configuration option is an array of environments that your application runs on and defines the worker process options for each environment. By default, this entry contains a `production` and `local` environment. However, you are free to add more environments as needed:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            'maxProcesses' => 10,




 5            'balanceMaxShift' => 1,




 6            'balanceCooldown' => 3,




 7        ],




 8    ],




 9 



10    'local' => [




11        'supervisor-1' => [




12            'maxProcesses' => 3,




13        ],




14    ],




15],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            'maxProcesses' => 10,
            'balanceMaxShift' => 1,
            'balanceCooldown' => 3,
        ],
    ],

    'local' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            'maxProcesses' => 3,
        ],
    ],
],

```

You may also define a wildcard environment (`*`) which will be used when no other matching environment is found:
```


1'environments' => [




2    // ...




3 



4    '*' => [




5        'supervisor-1' => [




6            'maxProcesses' => 3,




7        ],




8    ],




9],




'environments' => [
    // ...

    '*' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            'maxProcesses' => 3,
        ],
    ],
],

```

When you start Horizon, it will use the worker process configuration options for the environment that your application is running on. Typically, the environment is determined by the value of the `APP_ENV` [environment variable](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/configuration#determining-the-current-environment). For example, the default `local` Horizon environment is configured to start three worker processes and automatically balance the number of worker processes assigned to each queue. The default `production` environment is configured to start a maximum of 10 worker processes and automatically balance the number of worker processes assigned to each queue.
You should ensure that the `environments` portion of your `horizon` configuration file contains an entry for each [environment](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/configuration#environment-configuration) on which you plan to run Horizon.
#### [Supervisors](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#supervisors)
As you can see in Horizon's default configuration file, each environment can contain one or more "supervisors". By default, the configuration file defines this supervisor as `supervisor-1`; however, you are free to name your supervisors whatever you want. Each supervisor is essentially responsible for "supervising" a group of worker processes and takes care of balancing worker processes across queues.
You may add additional supervisors to a given environment if you would like to define a new group of worker processes that should run in that environment. You may choose to do this if you would like to define a different balancing strategy or worker process count for a given queue used by your application.
#### [Maintenance Mode](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#maintenance-mode)
While your application is in [maintenance mode](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/configuration#maintenance-mode), queued jobs will not be processed by Horizon unless the supervisor's `force` option is defined as `true` within the Horizon configuration file:
```


1'environments' => [




2    'production' => [




3        'supervisor-1' => [




4            // ...




5            'force' => true,




6        ],




7    ],




8],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'force' => true,
        ],
    ],
],

```

#### [Default Values](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#default-values)
Within Horizon's default configuration file, you will notice a `defaults` configuration option. This configuration option specifies the default values for your application's [supervisors](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#supervisors). The supervisor's default configuration values will be merged into the supervisor's configuration for each environment, allowing you to avoid unnecessary repetition when defining your supervisors.
### [Dashboard Authorization](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#dashboard-authorization)
The Horizon dashboard may be accessed via the `/horizon` route. By default, you will only be able to access this dashboard in the `local` environment. However, within your `app/Providers/HorizonServiceProvider.php` file, there is an [authorization gate](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/authorization#gates) definition. This authorization gate controls access to Horizon in **non-local** environments. You are free to modify this gate as needed to restrict access to your Horizon installation:
```


 1/**




 2 * Register the Horizon gate.




 3 *




 4 * This gate determines who can access Horizon in non-local environments.




 5 */




 6protected function gate(): void




 7{




 8    Gate::define('viewHorizon', function (User $user) {




 9        return in_array($user->email, [




10            'taylor@laravel.com',




11        ]);




12    });




13}




/**
 * Register the Horizon gate.
 *
 * This gate determines who can access Horizon in non-local environments.
 */
protected function gate(): void
{
    Gate::define('viewHorizon', function (User $user) {
        return in_array($user->email, [
            'taylor@laravel.com',
        ]);
    });
}

```

#### [Alternative Authentication Strategies](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#alternative-authentication-strategies)
Remember that Laravel automatically injects the authenticated user into the gate closure. If your application is providing Horizon security via another method, such as IP restrictions, then your Horizon users may not need to "login". Therefore, you will need to change `function (User $user)` closure signature above to `function (User $user = null)` in order to force Laravel to not require authentication.
### [Max Job Attempts](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#max-job-attempts)
Before refining these options, make sure you are familiar with Laravel's default [queue services](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queues#max-job-attempts-and-timeout) and the concept of 'attempts'.
You can define the maximum number of attempts a job can consume within a supervisor's configuration:
```


1'environments' => [




2    'production' => [




3        'supervisor-1' => [




4            // ...




5            'tries' => 10,




6        ],




7    ],




8],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'tries' => 10,
        ],
    ],
],

```

This option is similar to the `--tries` option when using the Artisan command to process queues.
Adjusting the `tries` option is essential when using middlewares such as `WithoutOverlapping` or `RateLimited` because they consume attempts. To handle this, adjust the `tries` configuration value either at the supervisor level or by defining the `$tries` property on the job class.
If you don't set the `tries` option, Horizon defaults to a single attempt, unless the job class defines `$tries`, which takes precedence over the Horizon configuration.
Setting `tries` or `$tries` to 0 allows unlimited attempts, which is ideal when the number of attempts is uncertain. To prevent endless failures, you can limit the number of exceptions allowed by setting the `$maxExceptions` property on the job class.
### [Job Timeout](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#job-timeout)
Similarly, you can set a `timeout` value at the supervisor level, which specifies how many seconds a worker process can run a job before it's forcefully terminated. Once terminated, the job will either be retried or marked as failed, depending on your queue configuration:
```


1'environments' => [




2    'production' => [




3        'supervisor-1' => [




4            // ...¨




5            'timeout' => 60,




6        ],




7    ],




8],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...¨
            'timeout' => 60,
        ],
    ],
],

```

When using the `auto` balancing strategy, Horizon will consider in-progress workers as "hanging" and force-kill them after the Horizon timeout during scale down. Always ensure the Horizon timeout is greater than any job-level timeout, otherwise jobs may be terminated mid-execution. In addition, the `timeout` value should always be at least a few seconds shorter than the `retry_after` value defined in your `config/queue.php` configuration file. Otherwise, your jobs may be processed twice.
### [Job Backoff](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#job-backoff)
You can define the `backoff` value at the supervisor level to specify how long Horizon should wait before retrying a job that encounters an unhandled exception:
```


1'environments' => [




2    'production' => [




3        'supervisor-1' => [




4            // ...




5            'backoff' => 10,




6        ],




7    ],




8],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'backoff' => 10,
        ],
    ],
],

```

You may also configure "exponential" backoffs by using an array for the `backoff` value. In this example, the retry delay will be 1 second for the first retry, 5 seconds for the second retry, 10 seconds for the third retry, and 10 seconds for every subsequent retry if there are more attempts remaining:
```


1'environments' => [




2    'production' => [




3        'supervisor-1' => [




4            // ...




5            'backoff' => [1, 5, 10],




6        ],




7    ],




8],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'backoff' => [1, 5, 10],
        ],
    ],
],

```

### [Silenced Jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#silenced-jobs)
Sometimes, you may not be interested in viewing certain jobs dispatched by your application or third-party packages. Instead of these jobs taking up space in your "Completed Jobs" list, you can silence them. To get started, add the job's class name to the `silenced` configuration option in your application's `horizon` configuration file:
```


1'silenced' => [




2    App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast::class,




3],




'silenced' => [
    App\Jobs\ProcessPodcast::class,
],

```

In addition to silencing individual job classes, Horizon also supports silencing jobs based on [tags](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#tags). This can be useful if you want to hide multiple jobs that share a common tag:
```


1'silenced_tags' => [




2    'notifications'




3],




'silenced_tags' => [
    'notifications'
],

```

Alternatively, the job you wish to silence can implement the `Laravel\Horizon\Contracts\Silenced` interface. If a job implements this interface, it will automatically be silenced, even if it is not present in the `silenced` configuration array:
```


1use Laravel\Horizon\Contracts\Silenced;




2 



3class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, Silenced




4{




5    use Queueable;




6 



7    // ...




8}




use Laravel\Horizon\Contracts\Silenced;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, Silenced
{
    use Queueable;

    // ...
}

```

## [Balancing Strategies](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#balancing-strategies)
Each supervisor can process one or more queues but unlike Laravel's default queue system, Horizon allows you to choose from three worker balancing strategies: `auto`, `simple`, and `false`.
### [Auto Balancing](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#auto-balancing)
The `auto` strategy, which is the default strategy, adjusts the number of worker processes per queue based on the current workload of the queue. For example, if your `notifications` queue has 1,000 pending jobs while your `default` queue is empty, Horizon will allocate more workers to your `notifications` queue until the queue is empty.
When using the `auto` strategy, you may also configure the `minProcesses` and `maxProcesses` configuration options:
  * `minProcesses` defines the minimum number of worker processes per queue. This value must be greater than or equal to 1.
  * `maxProcesses` defines the maximum total number of worker processes Horizon may scale up to across all queues. This value should typically be greater than the number of queues multiplied by the `minProcesses` value. To prevent the supervisor from spawning any processes, you may set this value to 0.


For example, you may configure Horizon to maintain at least one process per queue and scale up to a total of 10 worker processes:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            'connection' => 'redis',




 5            'queue' => ['default', 'notifications'],




 6            'balance' => 'auto',




 7            'autoScalingStrategy' => 'time',




 8            'minProcesses' => 1,




 9            'maxProcesses' => 10,




10            'balanceMaxShift' => 1,




11            'balanceCooldown' => 3,




12        ],




13    ],




14],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            'connection' => 'redis',
            'queue' => ['default', 'notifications'],
            'balance' => 'auto',
            'autoScalingStrategy' => 'time',
            'minProcesses' => 1,
            'maxProcesses' => 10,
            'balanceMaxShift' => 1,
            'balanceCooldown' => 3,
        ],
    ],
],

```

The `autoScalingStrategy` configuration option determines how Horizon will assign more worker processes to queues. You can choose between two strategies:
  * The `time` strategy will assign workers based on the total estimated amount of time it will take to clear the queue.
  * The `size` strategy will assign workers based on the total number of jobs on the queue.


The `balanceMaxShift` and `balanceCooldown` configuration values determine how quickly Horizon will scale to meet worker demand. In the example above, a maximum of one new process will be created or destroyed every three seconds. You are free to tweak these values as necessary based on your application's needs.
#### [Queue Priorities and Auto Balancing](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#auto-queue-priorities)
When using the `auto` balancing strategy, Horizon does not enforce strict priority between queues. The order of queues in a supervisor's configuration does not affect how worker processes are assigned. Instead, Horizon relies on the selected `autoScalingStrategy` to dynamically allocate worker processes based on queue load.
For example, in the following configuration, the high queue is not prioritized over the default queue, despite appearing first in the list:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            // ...




 5            'queue' => ['high', 'default'],




 6            'minProcesses' => 1,




 7            'maxProcesses' => 10,




 8        ],




 9    ],




10],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['high', 'default'],
            'minProcesses' => 1,
            'maxProcesses' => 10,
        ],
    ],
],

```

If you need to enforce a relative priority between queues, you may define multiple supervisors and explicitly allocate processing resources:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            // ...




 5            'queue' => ['default'],




 6            'minProcesses' => 1,




 7            'maxProcesses' => 10,




 8        ],




 9        'supervisor-2' => [




10            // ...




11            'queue' => ['images'],




12            'minProcesses' => 1,




13            'maxProcesses' => 1,




14        ],




15    ],




16],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['default'],
            'minProcesses' => 1,
            'maxProcesses' => 10,
        ],
        'supervisor-2' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['images'],
            'minProcesses' => 1,
            'maxProcesses' => 1,
        ],
    ],
],

```

In this example, the default `queue` can scale up to 10 processes, while the `images` queue is limited to one process. This configuration ensures that your queues can scale independently.
When dispatching resource-intensive jobs, it's sometimes best to assign them to a dedicated queue with a limited `maxProcesses` value. Otherwise, these jobs could consume excessive CPU resources and overload your system.
### [Simple Balancing](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#simple-balancing)
The `simple` strategy distributes worker processes evenly across the specified queues. With this strategy, Horizon does not automatically scale the number of worker processes. Rather, it uses a fixed number of processes:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            // ...




 5            'queue' => ['default', 'notifications'],




 6            'balance' => 'simple',




 7            'processes' => 10,




 8        ],




 9    ],




10],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['default', 'notifications'],
            'balance' => 'simple',
            'processes' => 10,
        ],
    ],
],

```

In the example above, Horizon will assign 5 processes to each queue, splitting the total of 10 evenly.
If you'd like to control the number of worker processes assigned to each queue individually, you can define multiple supervisors:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            // ...




 5            'queue' => ['default'],




 6            'balance' => 'simple',




 7            'processes' => 10,




 8        ],




 9        'supervisor-notifications' => [




10            // ...




11            'queue' => ['notifications'],




12            'balance' => 'simple',




13            'processes' => 2,




14        ],




15    ],




16],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['default'],
            'balance' => 'simple',
            'processes' => 10,
        ],
        'supervisor-notifications' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['notifications'],
            'balance' => 'simple',
            'processes' => 2,
        ],
    ],
],

```

With this configuration, Horizon will assign 10 processes to the `default` queue and 2 processes to the `notifications` queue.
### [No Balancing](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#no-balancing)
When the `balance` option is set to `false`, Horizon processes queues strictly in the order they're listed, similar to Laravel's default queue system. However, it will still scale the number of worker processes if jobs begin to accumulate:
```


 1'environments' => [




 2    'production' => [




 3        'supervisor-1' => [




 4            // ...




 5            'queue' => ['default', 'notifications'],




 6            'balance' => false,




 7            'minProcesses' => 1,




 8            'maxProcesses' => 10,




 9        ],




10    ],




11],




'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            // ...
            'queue' => ['default', 'notifications'],
            'balance' => false,
            'minProcesses' => 1,
            'maxProcesses' => 10,
        ],
    ],
],

```

In the example above, jobs in the `default` queue are always prioritized over jobs in the `notifications` queue. For instance, if there are 1,000 jobs in `default` and only 10 in `notifications`, Horizon will fully process all `default` jobs before handling any from `notifications`.
You can control Horizon's ability to scale worker processes using the `minProcesses` and `maxProcesses` options:
  * `minProcesses` defines the minimum number of worker processes in total. This value must be greater than or equal to 1.
  * `maxProcesses` defines the maximum total number of worker processes Horizon may scale up to.


## [Upgrading Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#upgrading-horizon)
When upgrading to a new major version of Horizon, it's important that you carefully review
## [Running Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#running-horizon)
Once you have configured your supervisors and workers in your application's `config/horizon.php` configuration file, you may start Horizon using the `horizon` Artisan command. This single command will start all of the configured worker processes for the current environment:
```


1php artisan horizon




php artisan horizon

```

You may pause the Horizon process and instruct it to continue processing jobs using the `horizon:pause` and `horizon:continue` Artisan commands:
```


1php artisan horizon:pause




2 



3php artisan horizon:continue




php artisan horizon:pause

php artisan horizon:continue

```

You may also pause and continue specific Horizon [supervisors](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#supervisors) using the `horizon:pause-supervisor` and `horizon:continue-supervisor` Artisan commands:
```


1php artisan horizon:pause-supervisor supervisor-1




2 



3php artisan horizon:continue-supervisor supervisor-1




php artisan horizon:pause-supervisor supervisor-1

php artisan horizon:continue-supervisor supervisor-1

```

You may check the current status of the Horizon process using the `horizon:status` Artisan command:
```


1php artisan horizon:status




php artisan horizon:status

```

You may check the current status of a specific Horizon [supervisor](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#supervisors) using the `horizon:supervisor-status` Artisan command:
```


1php artisan horizon:supervisor-status supervisor-1




php artisan horizon:supervisor-status supervisor-1

```

You may gracefully terminate the Horizon process using the `horizon:terminate` Artisan command. Any jobs that are currently being processed will be completed and then Horizon will stop executing:
```


1php artisan horizon:terminate




php artisan horizon:terminate

```

#### [Automatically Restarting Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#automatically-restarting-horizon)
During local development, you may run the `horizon:listen` command. When using the `horizon:listen` command, you don't have to manually restart Horizon when you want to reload your updated code. Before using this feature, you should ensure that
```


1npm install --save-dev chokidar




npm install --save-dev chokidar

```

Once Chokidar is installed, you may start Horizon using the `horizon:listen` command:
```


1php artisan horizon:listen




php artisan horizon:listen

```

When running within Docker or Vagrant, you should use the `--poll` option:
```


1php artisan horizon:listen --poll




php artisan horizon:listen --poll

```

You may configure the directories and files that should be watched using the `watch` configuration option within your application's `config/horizon.php` configuration file:
```


 1'watch' => [




 2    'app',




 3    'bootstrap',




 4    'config',




 5    'database',




 6    'public/**/*.php',




 7    'resources/**/*.php',




 8    'routes',




 9    'composer.lock',




10    '.env',




11],




'watch' => [
    'app',
    'bootstrap',
    'config',
    'database',
    'public/**/*.php',
    'resources/**/*.php',
    'routes',
    'composer.lock',
    '.env',
],

```

### [Deploying Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#deploying-horizon)
When you're ready to deploy Horizon to your application's actual server, you should configure a process monitor to monitor the `php artisan horizon` command and restart it if it exits unexpectedly. Don't worry, we'll discuss how to install a process monitor below.
During your application's deployment process, you should instruct the Horizon process to terminate so that it will be restarted by your process monitor and receive your code changes:
```


1php artisan horizon:terminate




php artisan horizon:terminate

```

#### [Installing Supervisor](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#installing-supervisor)
Supervisor is a process monitor for the Linux operating system and will automatically restart your `horizon` process if it stops executing. To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command. If you are not using Ubuntu, you can likely install Supervisor using your operating system's package manager:
```


1sudo apt-get install supervisor




sudo apt-get install supervisor

```

If configuring Supervisor yourself sounds overwhelming, consider using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com), which can manage background processes for your Laravel applications.
#### [Supervisor Configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#supervisor-configuration)
Supervisor configuration files are typically stored within your server's `/etc/supervisor/conf.d` directory. Within this directory, you may create any number of configuration files that instruct supervisor how your processes should be monitored. For example, let's create a `horizon.conf` file that starts and monitors a `horizon` process:
```


1[program:horizon]




2process_name=%(program_name)s




3command=php /home/forge/example.com/artisan horizon




4autostart=true




5autorestart=true




6user=forge




7redirect_stderr=true




8stdout_logfile=/home/forge/example.com/horizon.log




9stopwaitsecs=3600




[program:horizon]
process_name=%(program_name)s
command=php /home/forge/example.com/artisan horizon
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=forge
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/example.com/horizon.log
stopwaitsecs=3600

```

When defining your Supervisor configuration, you should ensure that the value of `stopwaitsecs` is greater than the number of seconds consumed by your longest running job. Otherwise, Supervisor may kill the job before it is finished processing.
While the examples above are valid for Ubuntu based servers, the location and file extension expected of Supervisor configuration files may vary between other server operating systems. Please consult your server's documentation for more information.
#### [Starting Supervisor](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#starting-supervisor)
Once the configuration file has been created, you may update the Supervisor configuration and start the monitored processes using the following commands:
```


1sudo supervisorctl reread




2 



3sudo supervisorctl update




4 



5sudo supervisorctl start horizon




sudo supervisorctl reread

sudo supervisorctl update

sudo supervisorctl start horizon

```

For more information on running Supervisor, consult the
## [Tags](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#tags)
Horizon allows you to assign "tags" to jobs, including mailables, broadcast events, notifications, and queued event listeners. In fact, Horizon will intelligently and automatically tag most jobs depending on the Eloquent models that are attached to the job. For example, take a look at the following job:
```


 1<?php




 2 



 3namespace App\Jobs;




 4 



 5use App\Models\Video;




 6use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;




 7use Illuminate\Foundation\Queue\Queueable;




 8 



 9class RenderVideo implements ShouldQueue




10{




11    use Queueable;




12 



13    /**




14     * Create a new job instance.




15     */




16    public function __construct(




17        public Video $video,




18    ) {}




19 



20    /**




21     * Execute the job.




22     */




23    public function handle(): void




24    {




25        // ...




26    }




27}




<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

use App\Models\Video;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Queue\Queueable;

class RenderVideo implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;

    /**
     * Create a new job instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        public Video $video,
    ) {}

    /**
     * Execute the job.
     */
    public function handle(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}

```

If this job is queued with an `App\Models\Video` instance that has an `id` attribute of `1`, it will automatically receive the tag `App\Models\Video:1`. This is because Horizon will search the job's properties for any Eloquent models. If Eloquent models are found, Horizon will intelligently tag the job using the model's class name and primary key:
```


1use App\Jobs\RenderVideo;




2use App\Models\Video;




3 



4$video = Video::find(1);




5 



6RenderVideo::dispatch($video);




use App\Jobs\RenderVideo;
use App\Models\Video;

$video = Video::find(1);

RenderVideo::dispatch($video);

```

#### [Manually Tagging Jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#manually-tagging-jobs)
If you would like to manually define the tags for one of your queueable objects, you may define a `tags` method on the class:
```


 1class RenderVideo implements ShouldQueue




 2{




 3    /**




 4     * Get the tags that should be assigned to the job.




 5     *




 6     * @return array<int, string>




 7     */




 8    public function tags(): array




 9    {




10        return ['render', 'video:'.$this->video->id];




11    }




12}




class RenderVideo implements ShouldQueue
{
    /**
     * Get the tags that should be assigned to the job.
     *
     * @return array<int, string>
     */
    public function tags(): array
    {
        return ['render', 'video:'.$this->video->id];
    }
}

```

#### [Manually Tagging Event Listeners](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#manually-tagging-event-listeners)
When retrieving the tags for a queued event listener, Horizon will automatically pass the event instance to the `tags` method, allowing you to add event data to the tags:
```


 1class SendRenderNotifications implements ShouldQueue




 2{




 3    /**




 4     * Get the tags that should be assigned to the listener.




 5     *




 6     * @return array<int, string>




 7     */




 8    public function tags(VideoRendered $event): array




 9    {




10        return ['video:'.$event->video->id];




11    }




12}




class SendRenderNotifications implements ShouldQueue
{
    /**
     * Get the tags that should be assigned to the listener.
     *
     * @return array<int, string>
     */
    public function tags(VideoRendered $event): array
    {
        return ['video:'.$event->video->id];
    }
}

```

## [Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#notifications)
When configuring Horizon to send Slack or SMS notifications, you should review the [prerequisites for the relevant notification channel](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/notifications).
If you would like to be notified when one of your queues has a long wait time, you may use the `Horizon::routeMailNotificationsTo`, `Horizon::routeSlackNotificationsTo`, and `Horizon::routeSmsNotificationsTo` methods. You may call these methods from the `boot` method of your application's `App\Providers\HorizonServiceProvider`:
```


 1/**




 2 * Bootstrap any application services.




 3 */




 4public function boot(): void




 5{




 6    parent::boot();




 7 



 8    Horizon::routeSmsNotificationsTo('15556667777');




 9    Horizon::routeMailNotificationsTo('example@example.com');




10    Horizon::routeSlackNotificationsTo('slack-webhook-url', '#channel');




11}




/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    parent::boot();

    Horizon::routeSmsNotificationsTo('15556667777');
    Horizon::routeMailNotificationsTo('example@example.com');
    Horizon::routeSlackNotificationsTo('slack-webhook-url', '#channel');
}

```

#### [Configuring Notification Wait Time Thresholds](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#configuring-notification-wait-time-thresholds)
You may configure how many seconds are considered a "long wait" within your application's `config/horizon.php` configuration file. The `waits` configuration option within this file allows you to control the long wait threshold for each connection / queue combination. Any undefined connection / queue combinations will default to a long wait threshold of 60 seconds:
```


1'waits' => [




2    'redis:critical' => 30,




3    'redis:default' => 60,




4    'redis:batch' => 120,




5],




'waits' => [
    'redis:critical' => 30,
    'redis:default' => 60,
    'redis:batch' => 120,
],

```

Setting a queue's threshold to `0` will disable long wait notifications for that queue.
## [Metrics](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#metrics)
Horizon includes a metrics dashboard which provides information regarding your job and queue wait times and throughput. In order to populate this dashboard, you should configure Horizon's `snapshot` Artisan command to run every five minutes in your application's `routes/console.php` file:
```


1use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;




2 



3Schedule::command('horizon:snapshot')->everyFiveMinutes();




use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('horizon:snapshot')->everyFiveMinutes();

```

If you would like to delete all metric data, you can invoke the `horizon:clear-metrics` Artisan command:
```


1php artisan horizon:clear-metrics




php artisan horizon:clear-metrics

```

## [Deleting Failed Jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#deleting-failed-jobs)
If you would like to delete a failed job, you may use the `horizon:forget` command. The `horizon:forget` command accepts the ID or UUID of the failed job as its only argument:
```


1php artisan horizon:forget 5




php artisan horizon:forget 5

```

If you would like to delete all failed jobs, you may provide the `--all` option to the `horizon:forget` command:
```


1php artisan horizon:forget --all




php artisan horizon:forget --all

```

## [Clearing Jobs From Queues](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/horizon#clearing-jobs-from-queues)
If you would like to delete all jobs from your application's default queue, you may do so using the `horizon:clear` Artisan command:
```


1php artisan horizon:clear




php artisan horizon:clear

```

You may provide the `queue` option to delete jobs from a specific queue:
```


1php artisan horizon:clear --queue=emails




php artisan horizon:clear --queue=emails

```

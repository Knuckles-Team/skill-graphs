# Getting started with Vercel
Last updated September 24, 2025
Vercel is a platform for developers that provides the tools, workflows, and infrastructure you need to build and deploy your web apps faster, without the need for additional configuration.
Vercel supports [popular frontend frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) out-of-the-box, and its scalable, secure infrastructure is globally distributed to serve content from data centers near your users for optimal speeds.
During development, Vercel provides tools for real-time collaboration on your projects such as automatic preview and production environments, and comments on preview deployments.
##  [Before you begin](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel#before-you-begin)[](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel#before-you-begin)
To get started, create an account with Vercel. You can [select the plan](https://vercel.com/docs/plans) that's right for you.
  * [Sign up for a new Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
  * [Log in to your existing Vercel account](https://vercel.com/login)


Once you create an account, you can choose to authenticate either with a Git provider or by using an email. When using email authentication, you may need to confirm both your email address and a phone number.
##  [Customizing your journey](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel#customizing-your-journey)[](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel#customizing-your-journey)
This tutorial is framework agnostic but Vercel supports many frontend [frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks). As you go through the docs, the quickstarts will provide specific instructions for your framework. If you don't find what you need, give us feedback and we'll update them!
While many of our instructions use the dashboard, you can also use [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) to carry out most tasks on Vercel. In this tutorial, look for the "Using CLI?" section for the CLI steps. To use the CLI, you'll need to install it:
Terminal
![](https://7nyt0uhk7sse4zvn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs-assets/static/topics/icons/pnpm.svg)pnpm bun yarn npm
```
pnpm i -g vercel
```

```
yarn global add vercel
```

```
npm i -g vercel
```

```
bun add -g vercel
```

I'm encountering an error and reviewing the docs at https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel.md to understand what's happening. Please help me resolve this by: 1. **Suggest the fix**: Analyze my codebase context and propose what needs to be changed to resolve this error. If you do not have access to my codebase, ask me for the codebase and try to fix the error based on the information you have. 2. **Explain the root cause**: Break down why this error occurred: - What was the code actually doing vs. what it needed to do? - What conditions triggered this specific error? - What misconception or oversight led to this? 3. **Teach the concept**: Help me understand the underlying principle: - Why does this error exist and what is it protecting me from? - What's the correct mental model for this concept? - How does this fit into the broader framework/language design? 4. **Show warning signs**: Help me recognize this pattern in the future: - What should I look out for that might cause this again? - Are there similar mistakes I might make in related scenarios? - What code smells or patterns indicate this issue? 5. **Discuss alternatives**: Explain if there are different valid approaches and their trade-offs My goal is to fix the immediate issue while building lasting understanding so I can avoid and resolve similar errors independently in the future.
To troubleshoot this error, follow these steps:
  1. Review DNS configuration: Check the [DNS configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/working-with-dns) to ensure that it's correctly set up and doesn't have any empty or incorrect entries
  2. Check for private IP addresses: Ensure that the request isn't attempting to connect to a private IP address from an external source
  3. Review application logs: Inspect the [application logs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/logs) for any warnings or errors related to DNS or the attempted connections

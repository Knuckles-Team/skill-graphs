Handlers
# Progress Monitoring
Copy page
Handle progress notifications from long-running server operations.
Copy page
`2.3.5` Use this when you need to track progress of long-running operations. MCP servers can report progress during operations. The client receives these updates through a progress handler.
##
[​](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/progress#progress-handler)
Progress Handler
Set a handler when creating the client:
Copy
```
from fastmcp import Client

async def progress_handler(
    progress: float,
    total: float | None,
    message: str | None
) -> None:
    if total is not None:
        percentage = (progress / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.1f}% - {message or ''}")
    else:
        print(f"Progress: {progress} - {message or ''}")

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    progress_handler=progress_handler
)

```

The handler receives three parameters:
## Handler Parameters
[​](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/progress#param-progress)
progress
float
Current progress value
[​](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/progress#param-total)
total
float | None
Expected total value (may be None if unknown)
[​](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/progress#param-message)
message
str | None
Optional status message
##
[​](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/progress#per-call-handler)
Per-Call Handler
Override the client-level handler for specific tool calls:
Copy
```
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task",
        {"param": "value"},
        progress_handler=my_progress_handler
    )

```

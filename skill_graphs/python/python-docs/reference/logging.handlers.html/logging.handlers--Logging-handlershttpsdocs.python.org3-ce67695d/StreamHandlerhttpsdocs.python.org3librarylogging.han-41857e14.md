## StreamHandler[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#streamhandler "Link to this heading")
The [`StreamHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler "logging.StreamHandler") class, located in the core [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") package, sends logging output to streams such as _sys.stdout_ , _sys.stderr_ or any file-like object (or, more precisely, any object which supports `write()` and `flush()` methods).

_class_ logging.StreamHandler(_stream =None_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler "Link to this definition")

Returns a new instance of the `StreamHandler` class. If _stream_ is specified, the instance will use it for logging output; otherwise, _sys.stderr_ will be used.

emit(_record_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler.emit "Link to this definition")

If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record. The record is then written to the stream followed by [`terminator`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler.terminator "logging.StreamHandler.terminator"). If exception information is present, it is formatted using [`traceback.print_exception()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html#traceback.print_exception "traceback.print_exception") and appended to the stream.

flush()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler.flush "Link to this definition")

Flushes the stream by calling its `flush()` method. Note that the `close()` method is inherited from [`Handler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Handler "logging.Handler") and so does no output, so an explicit `flush()` call may be needed at times.

setStream(_stream_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler.setStream "Link to this definition")

Sets the instance’s stream to the specified value, if it is different. The old stream is flushed before the new stream is set.

Parameters:

**stream** – The stream that the handler should use.

Returns:

the old stream, if the stream was changed, or `None` if it wasn’t.
Added in version 3.7.

terminator[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler.terminator "Link to this definition")

String used as the terminator when writing a formatted record to a stream. Default value is `'\n'`.
If you don’t want a newline termination, you can set the handler instance’s `terminator` attribute to the empty string.
In earlier versions, the terminator was hardcoded as `'\n'`.
Added in version 3.2.

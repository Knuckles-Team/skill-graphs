Reconfigure this text stream using new settings for _encoding_ , _errors_ , _newline_ , _line_buffering_ and _write_through_.
Parameters not specified keep current settings, except `errors='strict'` is used when _encoding_ is specified but _errors_ is not specified.
It is not possible to change the encoding or newline if some data has already been read from the stream. On the other hand, changing encoding after write is possible.
This method does an implicit stream flush before setting the new parameters.
Added in version 3.7.
Changed in version 3.11: The method supports `encoding="locale"` option.

seek(_cookie_ , _whence =os.SEEK_SET_, _/_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper.seek "Link to this definition")

Set the stream position. Return the new stream position as an [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int").
Four operations are supported, given by the following argument combinations:
  * `seek(0, SEEK_SET)`: Rewind to the start of the stream.
  * `seek(cookie, SEEK_SET)`: Restore a previous position; _cookie_ **must be** a number returned by [`tell()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper.tell "io.TextIOWrapper.tell").
  * `seek(0, SEEK_END)`: Fast-forward to the end of the stream.
  * `seek(0, SEEK_CUR)`: Leave the current stream position unchanged.


Any other argument combinations are invalid, and may raise exceptions.

tell()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper.tell "Link to this definition")

Return the stream position as an opaque number. The return value of `tell()` can be given as input to [`seek()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper.seek "io.TextIOWrapper.seek"), to restore a previous stream position.

_class_ io.StringIO(_initial_value =''_, _newline ='\n'_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.StringIO "Link to this definition")

A text stream using an in-memory text buffer. It inherits from [`TextIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase "io.TextIOBase").
The text buffer is discarded when the [`close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.close "io.IOBase.close") method is called.
The initial value of the buffer can be set by providing _initial_value_. If newline translation is enabled, newlines will be encoded as if by [`write()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write "io.TextIOBase.write"). The stream is positioned at the start of the buffer which emulates opening an existing file in a `w+` mode, making it ready for an immediate write from the beginning or for a write that would overwrite the initial value. To emulate opening a file in an `a+` mode ready for appending, use `f.seek(0, io.SEEK_END)` to reposition the stream at the end of the buffer.
The _newline_ argument works like that of [`TextIOWrapper`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper "io.TextIOWrapper"), except that when writing output to the stream, if _newline_ is `None`, newlines are written as `\n` on all platforms.
`StringIO` provides this method in addition to those from [`TextIOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase "io.TextIOBase") and [`IOBase`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase "io.IOBase"):

getvalue()[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.StringIO.getvalue "Link to this definition")

Return a [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") containing the entire contents of the buffer. Newlines are decoded as if by [`read()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.read "io.TextIOBase.read"), although the stream position is not changed.
Example usage:
Copy```
import io

output = io.StringIO()
output.write('First line.\n')
print('Second line.', file=output)

# Retrieve file contents -- this will be
# 'First line.\nSecond line.\n'
contents = output.getvalue()

# Close object and discard memory buffer --
# .getvalue() will now raise an exception.
output.close()

```


_class_ io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder "Link to this definition")

A helper codec that decodes newlines for [universal newlines](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-universal-newlines) mode. It inherits from [`codecs.IncrementalDecoder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.IncrementalDecoder "codecs.IncrementalDecoder").

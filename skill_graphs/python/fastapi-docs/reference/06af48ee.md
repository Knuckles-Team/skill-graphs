`status_code` |  The default status code to be used for the response. You could override the status code by returning a response directly. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/). **TYPE:** `int | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`tags` |  A list of tags to be applied to the _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags). **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`dependencies` |  A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the _path operation_.

`summary` |  A summary for the _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`description` |  A description for the _path operation_. If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the _path operation function_. It can contain Markdown. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/). **TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`response_description` |  The description for the default response. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `str` **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'`
`responses` |  Additional responses that could be returned by this _path operation_. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`deprecated` |  Mark this _path operation_ as deprecated. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). **TYPE:** `bool | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`operation_id` |  Custom operation ID to be used by this _path operation_. By default, it is generated automatically. If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API. You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function). **TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`response_model_include` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`response_model_exclude` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `IncEx | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`response_model_by_alias` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`
`response_model_exclude_unset` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default. When `True`, default values are omitted from the response. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`
`response_model_exclude_defaults` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response. When `True`, default values are omitted from the response. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`
`response_model_exclude_none` |  Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`. This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `False`
`include_in_schema` |  Include this _path operation_ in the generated OpenAPI schema. This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi). **TYPE:** `bool` **DEFAULT:** `True`
`response_class` |  Response class to be used for this _path operation_. This will not be used if you return a response directly. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse). **TYPE:** `type[Response[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/response/#fastapi.Response "<code class="doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class"></code>            <span class="doc doc-object-name doc-class-name">fastapi.Response</span> \(<code>starlette.responses.Response</code>\)")]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(JSONResponse[](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/responses/#fastapi.responses.JSONResponse "<code class="doc-symbol doc-symbol-heading doc-symbol-class"></code>            <span class="doc doc-object-name doc-class-name">fastapi.responses.JSONResponse</span> \(<code>starlette.responses.JSONResponse</code>\)"))`
`name` |  Name for this _path operation_. Only used internally. **TYPE:** `str | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`callbacks` |  List of _path operations_ that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks. This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly. It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`). Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/). **TYPE:** `list[BaseRoute] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`openapi_extra` |  Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this _path operation_. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema). **TYPE:** `dict[str, Any] | None` **DEFAULT:** `None`
`generate_unique_id_function` |  Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the _path operations_ shown in the generated OpenAPI. This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API. Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function). **TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]` **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)`

            The type to use for the response.

            It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
            be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
            etc.

            It will be used for:

            * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                show it as the response (JSON Schema).
            * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                corresponding JSON.
            * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                that `password`.
            * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

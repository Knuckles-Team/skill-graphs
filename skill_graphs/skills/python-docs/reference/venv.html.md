#  `venv` — Creation of virtual environments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "Link to this heading")
Added in version 3.3.
**Source code:**
* * *
`venv` module supports creating lightweight “virtual environments”, each with their own independent set of Python packages installed in their [`site`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site "site: Module responsible for site-specific configuration.") directories. A virtual environment is created on top of an existing Python installation, known as the virtual environment’s “base” Python, and by default is isolated from the packages in the base environment, so that only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available. See [Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys_path_init.html#sys-path-init-virtual-environments) and `site`’s [virtual environments documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site-virtual-environments-configuration) for more information.
When used from within a virtual environment, common installation tools such as
A virtual environment is (amongst other things):
  * Used to contain a specific Python interpreter and software libraries and binaries which are needed to support a project (library or application). These are by default isolated from software in other virtual environments and Python interpreters and libraries installed in the operating system.
  * Contained in a directory, conventionally named `.venv` or `venv` in the project directory, or under a container directory for lots of virtual environments, such as `~/.virtualenvs`.
  * Not checked into source control systems such as Git.
  * Considered as disposable – it should be simple to delete and recreate it from scratch. You don’t place any project code in the environment.
  * Not considered as movable or copyable – you just recreate the same environment in the target location.


See [**PEP 405**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/) for more background on Python virtual environments.

[Availability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#availability): not Android, not iOS, not WASI.
This module is not supported on [mobile platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#mobile-availability) or [WebAssembly platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html#wasm-availability).
## Creating virtual environments[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments "Link to this heading")
[Virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def) are created by executing the `venv` module:
```
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

```

This creates the target directory (including parent directories as needed) and places a `pyvenv.cfg` file in it with a `home` key pointing to the Python installation from which the command was run. It also creates a `bin` (or `Scripts` on Windows) subdirectory containing a copy or symlink of the Python executable (as appropriate for the platform or arguments used at environment creation time). It also creates a `lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` subdirectory (on Windows, this is `Lib\site-packages`). If an existing directory is specified, it will be reused.
Changed in version 3.5: The use of `venv` is now recommended for creating virtual environments.
Deprecated since version 3.6, removed in version 3.8: **pyvenv** was the recommended tool for creating virtual environments for Python 3.3 and 3.4, and replaced in 3.5 by executing `venv` directly.
On Windows, invoke the `venv` command as follows:
Copy```
PS> python -m venv C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment

```

The command, if run with `-h`, will show the available options:
```
usage: venv [-h] [--system-site-packages] [--symlinks | --copies] [--clear]
            [--upgrade] [--without-pip] [--prompt PROMPT] [--upgrade-deps]
            [--without-scm-ignore-files]
            ENV_DIR [ENV_DIR ...]

Creates virtual Python environments in one or more target directories.

Once an environment has been created, you may wish to activate it, e.g. by
sourcing an activate script in its bin directory.

```


ENV_DIR[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-arg-ENV_DIR "Link to this definition")

A required argument specifying the directory to create the environment in.

--system-site-packages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-system-site-packages "Link to this definition")

Give the virtual environment access to the system site-packages directory.

--symlinks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-symlinks "Link to this definition")

Try to use symlinks rather than copies, when symlinks are not the default for the platform.

--copies[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-copies "Link to this definition")

Try to use copies rather than symlinks, even when symlinks are the default for the platform.

--clear[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-clear "Link to this definition")

Delete the contents of the environment directory if it already exists, before environment creation.

--upgrade[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-upgrade "Link to this definition")

Upgrade the environment directory to use this version of Python, assuming Python has been upgraded in-place.

--without-pip[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-without-pip "Link to this definition")

Skips installing or upgrading pip in the virtual environment (pip is bootstrapped by default).

--prompt <PROMPT>[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-prompt "Link to this definition")

Provides an alternative prompt prefix for this environment.

--upgrade-deps[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-upgrade-deps "Link to this definition")

Upgrade core dependencies (pip) to the latest version in PyPI.

--without-scm-ignore-files[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#cmdoption-venv-without-scm-ignore-files "Link to this definition")

Skips adding SCM ignore files to the environment directory (Git is supported by default).
Changed in version 3.4: Installs pip by default, added the `--without-pip` and `--copies` options.
Changed in version 3.4: In earlier versions, if the target directory already existed, an error was raised, unless the `--clear` or `--upgrade` option was provided.
Changed in version 3.9: Add `--upgrade-deps` option to upgrade pip + setuptools to the latest on PyPI.
Changed in version 3.12: `setuptools` is no longer a core venv dependency.
Changed in version 3.13: Added the `--without-scm-ignore-files` option.
Changed in version 3.13: `venv` now creates a `.gitignore` file for Git by default.
Note
While symlinks are supported on Windows, they are not recommended. Of particular note is that double-clicking `python.exe` in File Explorer will resolve the symlink eagerly and ignore the virtual environment.
Note
On Microsoft Windows, it may be required to enable the `Activate.ps1` script by setting the execution policy for the user. You can do this by issuing the following PowerShell command:
```
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

```

See
The created `pyvenv.cfg` file also includes the `include-system-site-packages` key, set to `true` if `venv` is run with the `--system-site-packages` option, `false` otherwise.
Unless the `--without-pip` option is given, [`ensurepip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip "ensurepip: Bootstrapping the "pip" installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment.") will be invoked to bootstrap `pip` into the virtual environment.
Multiple paths can be given to `venv`, in which case an identical virtual environment will be created, according to the given options, at each provided path.
## How venvs work[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work "Link to this heading")
When a Python interpreter is running from a virtual environment, [`sys.prefix`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.prefix "sys.prefix") and [`sys.exec_prefix`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exec_prefix "sys.exec_prefix") point to the directories of the virtual environment, whereas [`sys.base_prefix`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.base_prefix "sys.base_prefix") and [`sys.base_exec_prefix`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.base_exec_prefix "sys.base_exec_prefix") point to those of the base Python used to create the environment. It is sufficient to check `sys.prefix != sys.base_prefix` to determine if the current interpreter is running from a virtual environment.
A virtual environment may be “activated” using a script in its binary directory (`bin` on POSIX; `Scripts` on Windows). This will prepend that directory to your `PATH`, so that running **python** will invoke the environment’s Python interpreter and you can run installed scripts without having to use their full path. The invocation of the activation script is platform-specific (`_<venv>_`must be replaced by the path to the directory containing the virtual environment):
Platform | Shell | Command to activate virtual environment
---|---|---
POSIX | bash/zsh | `$ source _<venv>_/bin/activate`
fish | `$ source _<venv>_/bin/activate.fish`
csh/tcsh | `$ source _<venv>_/bin/activate.csh`
pwsh | `$ _<venv>_/bin/Activate.ps1`
Windows | cmd.exe | `C:\> _<venv>_\Scripts\activate.bat`
PowerShell | `PS C:\> _<venv>_\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
Added in version 3.4: **fish** and **csh** activation scripts.
Added in version 3.8: PowerShell activation scripts installed under POSIX for PowerShell Core support.
You don’t specifically _need_ to activate a virtual environment, as you can just specify the full path to that environment’s Python interpreter when invoking Python. Furthermore, all scripts installed in the environment should be runnable without activating it.
In order to achieve this, scripts installed into virtual environments have a “shebang” line which points to the environment’s Python interpreter, `#!/_<path-to-venv>_/bin/python`. This means that the script will run with that interpreter regardless of the value of`PATH`. On Windows, “shebang” line processing is supported if you have the [Python install manager](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) installed. Thus, double-clicking an installed script in a Windows Explorer window should run it with the correct interpreter without the environment needing to be activated or on the `PATH`.
When a virtual environment has been activated, the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable is set to the path of the environment. Since explicitly activating a virtual environment is not required to use it, `VIRTUAL_ENV` cannot be relied upon to determine whether a virtual environment is being used.
Warning
Because scripts installed in environments should not expect the environment to be activated, their shebang lines contain the absolute paths to their environment’s interpreters. Because of this, environments are inherently non-portable, in the general case. You should always have a simple means of recreating an environment (for example, if you have a requirements file `requirements.txt`, you can invoke `pip install -r requirements.txt` using the environment’s `pip` to install all of the packages needed by the environment). If for any reason you need to move the environment to a new location, you should recreate it at the desired location and delete the one at the old location. If you move an environment because you moved a parent directory of it, you should recreate the environment in its new location. Otherwise, software installed into the environment may not work as expected.
You can deactivate a virtual environment by typing `deactivate` in your shell. The exact mechanism is platform-specific and is an internal implementation detail (typically, a script or shell function will be used).
## API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#api "Link to this heading")
The high-level method described above makes use of a simple API which provides mechanisms for third-party virtual environment creators to customize environment creation according to their needs, the [`EnvBuilder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder "venv.EnvBuilder") class.

_class_ venv.EnvBuilder(_system_site_packages =False_, _clear =False_, _symlinks =False_, _upgrade =False_, _with_pip =False_, _prompt =None_, _upgrade_deps =False_, _*_ , _scm_ignore_files =frozenset()_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder "Link to this definition")

The `EnvBuilder` class accepts the following keyword arguments on instantiation:
  * _system_site_packages_ – a boolean value indicating that the system Python site-packages should be available to the environment (defaults to `False`).
  * _clear_ – a boolean value which, if true, will delete the contents of any existing target directory, before creating the environment.
  * _symlinks_ – a boolean value indicating whether to attempt to symlink the Python binary rather than copying.
  * _upgrade_ – a boolean value which, if true, will upgrade an existing environment with the running Python - for use when that Python has been upgraded in-place (defaults to `False`).
  * _with_pip_ – a boolean value which, if true, ensures pip is installed in the virtual environment. This uses [`ensurepip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip "ensurepip: Bootstrapping the "pip" installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment.") with the `--default-pip` option.
  * _prompt_ – a string to be used after virtual environment is activated (defaults to `None` which means directory name of the environment would be used). If the special string `"."` is provided, the basename of the current directory is used as the prompt.
  * _upgrade_deps_ – Update the base venv modules to the latest on PyPI
  * _scm_ignore_files_ – Create ignore files based for the specified source control managers (SCM) in the iterable. Support is defined by having a method named `create_{scm}_ignore_file`. The only value supported by default is `"git"` via [`create_git_ignore_file()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create_git_ignore_file "venv.EnvBuilder.create_git_ignore_file").


Changed in version 3.4: Added the `with_pip` parameter
Changed in version 3.6: Added the `prompt` parameter
Changed in version 3.9: Added the `upgrade_deps` parameter
Changed in version 3.13: Added the `scm_ignore_files` parameter
`EnvBuilder` may be used as a base class.

create(_env_dir_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create "Link to this definition")

Create a virtual environment by specifying the target directory (absolute or relative to the current directory) which is to contain the virtual environment. The `create` method will either create the environment in the specified directory, or raise an appropriate exception.
The `create` method of the `EnvBuilder` class illustrates the hooks available for subclass customization:
Copy```
def create(self, env_dir):
    """
    Create a virtualized Python environment in a directory.
    env_dir is the target directory to create an environment in.
    """
    env_dir = os.path.abspath(env_dir)
    context = self.ensure_directories(env_dir)
    self.create_configuration(context)
    self.setup_python(context)
    self.setup_scripts(context)
    self.post_setup(context)

```

Each of the methods [`ensure_directories()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.ensure_directories "venv.EnvBuilder.ensure_directories"), [`create_configuration()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create_configuration "venv.EnvBuilder.create_configuration"), [`setup_python()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python"), [`setup_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts") and [`post_setup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup "venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup") can be overridden.

ensure_directories(_env_dir_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.ensure_directories "Link to this definition")

Creates the environment directory and all necessary subdirectories that don’t already exist, and returns a context object. This context object is just a holder for attributes (such as paths) for use by the other methods. If the `EnvBuilder` is created with the arg `clear=True`, contents of the environment directory will be cleared and then all necessary subdirectories will be recreated.
The returned context object is a [`types.SimpleNamespace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace "types.SimpleNamespace") with the following attributes:
  * `env_dir` - The location of the virtual environment. Used for `__VENV_DIR__` in activation scripts (see [`install_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts")).
  * `env_name` - The name of the virtual environment. Used for `__VENV_NAME__` in activation scripts (see [`install_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts")).
  * `prompt` - The prompt to be used by the activation scripts. Used for `__VENV_PROMPT__` in activation scripts (see [`install_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts")).
  * `executable` - The underlying Python executable used by the virtual environment. This takes into account the case where a virtual environment is created from another virtual environment.
  * `inc_path` - The include path for the virtual environment.
  * `lib_path` - The purelib path for the virtual environment.
  * `bin_path` - The script path for the virtual environment.
  * `bin_name` - The name of the script path relative to the virtual environment location. Used for `__VENV_BIN_NAME__` in activation scripts (see [`install_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts")).
  * `env_exe` - The name of the Python interpreter in the virtual environment. Used for `__VENV_PYTHON__` in activation scripts (see [`install_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts")).
  * `env_exec_cmd` - The name of the Python interpreter, taking into account filesystem redirections. This can be used to run Python in the virtual environment.


Changed in version 3.11: The _venv_ [sysconfig installation scheme](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#installation-paths) is used to construct the paths of the created directories.
Changed in version 3.12: The attribute `lib_path` was added to the context, and the context object was documented.

create_configuration(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create_configuration "Link to this definition")

Creates the `pyvenv.cfg` configuration file in the environment.

setup_python(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python "Link to this definition")

Creates a copy or symlink to the Python executable in the environment. On POSIX systems, if a specific executable `python3.x` was used, symlinks to `python` and `python3` will be created pointing to that executable, unless files with those names already exist.

setup_scripts(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts "Link to this definition")

Installs activation scripts appropriate to the platform into the virtual environment.

upgrade_dependencies(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.upgrade_dependencies "Link to this definition")

Upgrades the core venv dependency packages (currently `pip` executable in the environment.
Added in version 3.9.
Changed in version 3.12:

post_setup(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup "Link to this definition")

A placeholder method which can be overridden in third party implementations to pre-install packages in the virtual environment or perform other post-creation steps.

install_scripts(_context_ , _path_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.install_scripts "Link to this definition")

This method can be called from [`setup_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts") or [`post_setup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup "venv.EnvBuilder.post_setup") in subclasses to assist in installing custom scripts into the virtual environment.
_path_ is the path to a directory that should contain subdirectories `common`, `posix`, `nt`; each containing scripts destined for the `bin` directory in the environment. The contents of `common` and the directory corresponding to [`os.name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.name "os.name") are copied after some text replacement of placeholders:
  * `__VENV_DIR__` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment directory.
  * `__VENV_NAME__` is replaced with the environment name (final path segment of environment directory).
  * `__VENV_PROMPT__` is replaced with the prompt (the environment name surrounded by parentheses and with a following space)
  * `__VENV_BIN_NAME__` is replaced with the name of the bin directory (either `bin` or `Scripts`).
  * `__VENV_PYTHON__` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment’s executable.


The directories are allowed to exist (for when an existing environment is being upgraded).

create_git_ignore_file(_context_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create_git_ignore_file "Link to this definition")

Creates a `.gitignore` file within the virtual environment that causes the entire directory to be ignored by the Git source control manager.
Added in version 3.13.
Changed in version 3.7.2: Windows now uses redirector scripts for `python[w].exe` instead of copying the actual binaries. In 3.7.2 only [`setup_python()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python") does nothing unless running from a build in the source tree.
Changed in version 3.7.3: Windows copies the redirector scripts as part of [`setup_python()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_python") instead of [`setup_scripts()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts "venv.EnvBuilder.setup_scripts"). This was not the case in 3.7.2. When using symlinks, the original executables will be linked.
There is also a module-level convenience function:

venv.create(_env_dir_ , _system_site_packages =False_, _clear =False_, _symlinks =False_, _with_pip =False_, _prompt =None_, _upgrade_deps =False_, _*_ , _scm_ignore_files =frozenset()_)[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.create "Link to this definition")

Create an [`EnvBuilder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder "venv.EnvBuilder") with the given keyword arguments, and call its [`create()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder.create "venv.EnvBuilder.create") method with the _env_dir_ argument.
Added in version 3.3.
Changed in version 3.4: Added the _with_pip_ parameter
Changed in version 3.6: Added the _prompt_ parameter
Changed in version 3.9: Added the _upgrade_deps_ parameter
Changed in version 3.13: Added the _scm_ignore_files_ parameter
## An example of extending `EnvBuilder`[¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#an-example-of-extending-envbuilder "Link to this heading")
The following script shows how to extend [`EnvBuilder`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder "venv.EnvBuilder") by implementing a subclass which installs setuptools and pip into a created virtual environment:
Copy```
import os
import os.path
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
import sys
from threading import Thread
from urllib.parse import urlsplit
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
import venv

class ExtendedEnvBuilder(venv.EnvBuilder):
    """
    This builder installs setuptools and pip so that you can pip or
    easy_install other packages into the created virtual environment.

    :param nodist: If true, setuptools and pip are not installed into the
                   created virtual environment.
    :param nopip: If true, pip is not installed into the created
                  virtual environment.
    :param progress: If setuptools or pip are installed, the progress of the
                     installation can be monitored by passing a progress
                     callable. If specified, it is called with two
                     arguments: a string indicating some progress, and a
                     context indicating where the string is coming from.
                     The context argument can have one of three values:

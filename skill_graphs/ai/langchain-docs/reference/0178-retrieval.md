# Retrieval
Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they have two key limitations:

* **Finite context**—they can’t ingest entire corpora at once.
* **Static knowledge**—their training data is frozen at a point in time.

Retrieval addresses these problems by fetching relevant external knowledge at query time. This is the foundation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: enhancing an LLM’s answers with context-specific information.

## Building a knowledge base

A **knowledge base** is a repository of documents or structured data used during retrieval.

If you need a custom knowledge base, you can use LangChain’s document loaders and vector stores to build one from your own data.

<Note>
  If you already have a knowledge base (e.g., a SQL database, CRM, or internal documentation system), you do **not** need to rebuild it. You can:

  * Connect it as a **tool** for an agent in Agentic RAG.
  * Query it and supply the retrieved content as context to the LLM [(2-Step RAG)](#2-step-rag).
</Note>

See the following tutorial to build a searchable knowledge base and minimal RAG workflow:

</Card>

### From retrieval to RAG

Retrieval allows LLMs to access relevant context at runtime. But most real-world applications go one step further: they **integrate retrieval with generation** to produce grounded, context-aware answers.

This is the core idea behind **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The retrieval pipeline becomes a foundation for a broader system that combines search with generation.

### Retrieval pipeline

A typical retrieval workflow looks like this:

```mermaid theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
flowchart LR
  S(["Sources<br>(Google Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.)"]) --> L[Document Loaders]
  L --> A([Documents])
  A --> B[Split into chunks]
  B --> C[Turn into embeddings]
  C --> D[(Vector Store)]
  Q([User Query]) --> E[Query embedding]
  E --> D
  D --> F[Retriever]
  F --> G[LLM uses retrieved info]
  G --> H([Answer])

  classDef trigger fill:#F6FFDB,stroke:#6E8900,stroke-width:2px,color:#2E3900
  classDef process fill:#E5F4FF,stroke:#006DDD,stroke-width:2px,color:#030710

  class S,Q trigger
  class L,B,C,E,F,G process
  class D output
  class A,H neutral
```

Each component is modular: you can swap loaders, splitters, embeddings, or vector stores without rewriting the app’s logic.

## RAG architectures

RAG can be implemented in multiple ways, depending on your system's needs. We outline each type in the sections below.

| Architecture    | Description                                                                | Control   | Flexibility | Latency    | Example Use Case                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **2-Step RAG**  | Retrieval always happens before generation. Simple and predictable         | ✅ High    | ❌ Low       | ⚡ Fast     | FAQs, documentation bots                          |
| **Agentic RAG** | An LLM-powered agent decides *when* and *how* to retrieve during reasoning | ❌ Low     | ✅ High      | ⏳ Variable | Research assistants with access to multiple tools |
| **Hybrid**      | Combines characteristics of both approaches with validation steps          | ⚖️ Medium | ⚖️ Medium   | ⏳ Variable | Domain-specific Q\&A with quality validation      |

<Info>
  **Latency**: Latency is generally more **predictable** in **2-Step RAG**, as the maximum number of LLM calls is known and capped. This predictability assumes that LLM inference time is the dominant factor. However, real-world latency may also be affected by the performance of retrieval steps—such as API response times, network delays, or database queries—which can vary based on the tools and infrastructure in use.
</Info>

### 2-step RAG

In **2-Step RAG**, the retrieval step is always executed before the generation step. This architecture is straightforward and predictable, making it suitable for many applications where the retrieval of relevant documents is a clear prerequisite for generating an answer.

```mermaid theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
graph LR
    A[User Question] --> B["Retrieve Relevant Documents"]
    B --> C["Generate Answer"]
    C --> D[Return Answer to User]

</Card>

### Agentic RAG

**Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the strengths of Retrieval-Augmented Generation with agent-based reasoning. Instead of retrieving documents before answering, an agent (powered by an LLM) reasons step-by-step and decides **when** and **how** to retrieve information during the interaction.

<Tip>
  The only thing an agent needs to enable RAG behavior is access to one or more **tools** that can fetch external knowledge—such as documentation loaders, web APIs, or database queries.
</Tip>

```mermaid theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}

    A[User Input / Question] --> B["Agent (LLM)"]
    B --> C{Need external info?}

const agent = createAgent({

<Expandable title="Extended example: Agentic RAG for LangGraph's llms.txt">
  This example implements an **Agentic RAG system** to assist users in querying LangGraph documentation. The agent begins by loading [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/), which lists available documentation URLs, and can then dynamically use a `fetch_documentation` tool to retrieve and process the relevant content based on the user’s question.

  ```typescript theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
  import { tool, createAgent, HumanMessage } from "langchain";
  import * as z from "zod";

  const ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ["https://langchain-ai.github.io/"];
  const LLMS_TXT = "https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/llms.txt";

  const fetchDocumentation = tool(
    async (input) => {  // [!code highlight]
      if (!ALLOWED_DOMAINS.some((domain) => input.url.startsWith(domain))) {
        return `Error: URL not allowed. Must start with one of: ${ALLOWED_DOMAINS.join(", ")}`;
      }
      const response = await fetch(input.url);
      if (!response.ok) {

      return response.text();
    },
    {
      name: "fetch_documentation",

      schema: z.object({

    }
  );

  const llmsTxtResponse = await fetch(LLMS_TXT);
  const llmsTxtContent = await llmsTxtResponse.text();

### Hybrid RAG

Hybrid RAG combines characteristics of both 2-Step and Agentic RAG. It introduces intermediate steps such as query preprocessing, retrieval validation, and post-generation checks. These systems offer more flexibility than fixed pipelines while maintaining some control over execution.

Typical components include:

* **Query enhancement**: Modify the input question to improve retrieval quality. This can involve rewriting unclear queries, generating multiple variations, or expanding queries with additional context.
* **Retrieval validation**: Evaluate whether retrieved documents are relevant and sufficient. If not, the system may refine the query and retrieve again.
* **Answer validation**: Check the generated answer for accuracy, completeness, and alignment with source content. If needed, the system can regenerate or revise the answer.

The architecture often supports multiple iterations between these steps:

```mermaid theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
graph LR
    A[User Question] --> B[Query Enhancement]
    B --> C[Retrieve Documents]
    C --> D{Sufficient Info?}
    D -- No --> E[Refine Query]
    E --> C
    D -- Yes --> F[Generate Answer]
    F --> G{Answer Quality OK?}
    G -- No --> H{Try Different Approach?}
    H -- Yes --> E
    H -- No --> I[Return Best Answer]
    G -- Yes --> I
    I --> J[Return to User]

    class A,J startend
    class B,C,E,F,I process
    class D,G,H decision
```

* Applications with ambiguous or underspecified queries
* Systems that require validation or quality control steps
* Workflows involving multiple sources or iterative refinement

# Runtime
Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/runtime

## Overview

LangChain's `createAgent` runs on LangGraph's runtime under the hood.

LangGraph exposes a [`Runtime`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain/index/Runtime) object with the following information:

1. **Context**: static information like user id, db connections, or other dependencies for an agent invocation
2. **Store**: a [BaseStore](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain-core/stores/BaseStore) instance used for [long-term memory](/oss/javascript/langchain/long-term-memory)
3. **Stream writer**: an object used for streaming information via the `"custom"` stream mode
4. **Execution info**: identity and retry information for the current execution (thread ID, run ID, attempt number)
5. **Server info**: server-specific metadata when running on LangGraph Server (assistant ID, graph ID, authenticated user)

<Tip>
  The runtime context is how you thread data through your agent. Rather than storing things in global state, you can attach values—like a database connection, user session, or configuration—to the context and access them inside tools and middleware. This keeps things stateless, testable, and reusable.
</Tip>

You can access the runtime information within [tools](#inside-tools) and [middleware](#inside-middleware).

## Access

When creating an agent with `createAgent`, you can specify a `contextSchema` to define the structure of the `context` stored in the agent [`Runtime`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain/index/Runtime).

When invoking the agent, pass the `context` argument with the relevant configuration for the run:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import * as z from "zod";
import { createAgent } from "langchain";

const contextSchema = z.object({ // [!code highlight]
  userName: z.string(), // [!code highlight]
}); // [!code highlight]

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  tools: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  contextSchema, // [!code highlight]
});

const result = await agent.invoke(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's my name?" }] },
  { context: { userName: "John Smith" } } // [!code highlight]
);
```

### Inside tools

You can access the runtime information inside tools to:

* Access the context
* Read or write long-term memory
* Write to the [custom stream](/oss/javascript/langchain/streaming#custom-updates) (ex, tool progress / updates)

Use the `runtime` parameter to access the [`Runtime`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain/index/Runtime) object inside a tool.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import * as z from "zod";
import { tool } from "langchain";
import { type ToolRuntime } from "@langchain/core/tools"; // [!code highlight]

const contextSchema = z.object({
  userName: z.string(),
});

const fetchUserEmailPreferences = tool(
  async (_, runtime: ToolRuntime<any, typeof contextSchema>) => { // [!code highlight]
    const userName = runtime.context?.userName; // [!code highlight]
    if (!userName) {
      throw new Error("userName is required");
    }

    let preferences = "The user prefers you to write a brief and polite email.";
    if (runtime.store) { // [!code highlight]
      const memory = await runtime.store?.get(["users"], userName); // [!code highlight]
      if (memory) {
        preferences = memory.value.preferences;
      }
    }
    return preferences;
  },
  {
    name: "fetch_user_email_preferences",
    description: "Fetch the user's email preferences.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);
```

### Execution info and server info inside tools

Access execution identity (thread ID, run ID) via `runtime.executionInfo`, and server-specific metadata (assistant ID, authenticated user) via `runtime.serverInfo` when running on LangGraph Server:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { tool } from "langchain";
import * as z from "zod";

const contextAwareTool = tool(
  async (_input, runtime) => {
    // Access thread and run IDs
    const info = runtime.executionInfo;
    console.log(`Thread: ${info.threadId}, Run: ${info.runId}`);  // [!code highlight]

    // Access server info (only available on LangGraph Server)
    const server = runtime.serverInfo;
    if (server != null) {
      console.log(`Assistant: ${server.assistantId}`);  // [!code highlight]
      if (server.user != null) {
        console.log(`User: ${server.user.identity}`);  // [!code highlight]
      }
    }

    return "done";
  },
  {
    name: "context_aware_tool",
    description: "A tool that uses execution and server info.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);
```

`serverInfo` is `null` when not running on LangGraph Server (e.g., during local development).

<Note>
  Requires `deepagents>=1.9.0` (or `@langchain/langgraph>=1.2.8`) for `runtime.executionInfo` and `runtime.serverInfo`.
</Note>

### Inside middleware

You can access runtime information in middleware to create dynamic prompts, modify messages, or control agent behavior based on user context.

Use the `runtime` parameter to access the [`Runtime`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langchain/index/Runtime) object inside middleware.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import * as z from "zod";
import { createAgent, createMiddleware, SystemMessage } from "langchain";

const contextSchema = z.object({
  userName: z.string(),
});

// Dynamic prompt middleware
const dynamicPromptMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  name: "DynamicPrompt",
  contextSchema,
  beforeModel: (state, runtime) => { // [!code highlight]
    const userName = runtime.context?.userName; // [!code highlight]
    if (!userName) {
      throw new Error("userName is required");
    }

    const systemMsg = `You are a helpful assistant. Address the user as ${userName}.`;
    return {
      messages: [new SystemMessage(systemMsg), ...state.messages],
    };
  },
});

// Logging middleware
const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  name: "Logging",
  contextSchema,
  beforeModel: (state, runtime) => {  // [!code highlight]
    console.log(`Processing request for user: ${runtime.context?.userName}`);  // [!code highlight]
    return;
  },
  afterModel: (state, runtime) => {  // [!code highlight]
    console.log(`Completed request for user: ${runtime.context?.userName}`);  // [!code highlight]
    return;
  },
});

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  tools: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  middleware: [dynamicPromptMiddleware, loggingMiddleware],  // [!code highlight]
  contextSchema,
});

const result = await agent.invoke(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's my name?" }] },
  { context: { userName: "John Smith" } }
);

```

### Execution info and server info inside middleware

Middleware hooks can also access `runtime.executionInfo` and `runtime.serverInfo`:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { createMiddleware } from "langchain";

const authGate = createMiddleware({
  name: "AuthGate",
  beforeModel: (state, runtime) => {
    const server = runtime.serverInfo;
    if (server != null && server.user == null) {  // [!code highlight]
      throw new Error("Authentication required");
    }
    console.log(`Thread: ${runtime.executionInfo.threadId}`);  // [!code highlight]
    return;
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Requires `deepagents>=1.9.0` (or `@langchain/langgraph>=1.2.8`).
